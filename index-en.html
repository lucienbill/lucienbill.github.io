        <h2 class="emo-job">My job: Software Development Engineer in Test (SDET)</h2>
        <p>
        I've had many interesting discussions with Software Engineers who have been driven by passion from the very begining of their learning curriculum.
        </p>

        <p>
        I am not exactly like them.
        I graduated as a mechanical Engineer in 2013 with one very strong conviction: <i>"I suck at this"</i>.
        This oddly did'nt help me to find a job, but I didn't give up.
        I eventually found an offer that read like <i>"need a career change? Come in and learn to code"</i>.
        The only requirement was a master's degree, which I had!
        I thought : <i>"I'm already a nerd, let's fully embrace it"</i>.
        </p>

        <p>
        And so began my career in computer science: out of necessity.
        Luckily I quickly developed a genuine interest for it.
        My retraining went well and I became a Software Developper... 
        Then a developer who tests.
        </p>

        <p>
        I am now a tester who codes: while I leverage automation tools, I do keep in mind that they aren't magical.
        Put differently: doing the right thing manually has more value than automating the wrong thing.
        My main skills are:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-skills">
            <li>
                Writing tests for Software - <i>"What actions can be done to verify whether it does what we want it to do?"</i>
            </li>
            <li>
                Automating regresion tests - They must be run often to be useful, but doing so manually over and over is a chore
            </li>
            <li>
                Knowledge sharing - The key to an efficient testing process is teamwork
            </li>
        </ul>
