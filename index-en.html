        <h2 class="emo-job">My job: Software Testing Expert</h2>
        <p>
        I've had many interesting discussions with Software Engineers who have been driven by passion from the very begining of their learning curriculum.
        </p>

        <p>
        I am not exactly like them.
        I graduated as a mechanical Engineer in 2013 with a very strong belief: <i>"I suck at this"</i>.
        This oddly didn't help me to find a job, but I didn't give up.
        I eventually noticed an offer that read like <i>"need a career change? Come in and learn to code"</i>.
        The only requirement was a master's degree, which I had!
        I thought : <i>"I'm already a nerd, let's fully embrace it"</i>.
        </p>

        <p>
        And so began my career in computer science: out of necessity.
        Luckily I quickly grew genuinely interested in the domain, and met the right kind of people.
        My retraining as a software developer went well, and it didn't take me to long to get the importance of have my code properly tested.
        </p>

        <p>
        Little by little I have become a tester who codes: while I leverage automation tools, I do keep in mind that they aren't magical.
        Put differently: doing the right thing manually has more value than automating the wrong thing.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        Today, I'm using my skillset to help teams implement and improve their software testing practices.
        Because generally speaking, we all want to improve software quality.
        But figuring out "how" is not trivial.
        </p>
